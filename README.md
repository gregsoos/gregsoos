Added backticks let's us do this: `git push`

And triple backticks let's us do this:

```
git status
git add
git commit
```

Check out the website I published using a GitHub skills tutorial [here](https://gregsoos.github.io/communicate-using-markdown/)!

Let's try referencing a file from another repository. I made a [file called `index.md`](/../../../communicate-using-markdown/blob/main/index.md/) in another GitHub skills tutorial. :+1:

We can cite sources too![^1] This'll be great.

\#Escaping Markdown syntax by putting a backslash first

```Python
# This program prints Hello, world!

print('Hello, world!')
```
Throwing some Python code in for proof of concept. Using docs here[^2] for reference.
