# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is **Greg Soos** (he/him). I received my Bachelor's degree in physics from the **University of Pennsylvania** in December 2021, but my background is wider ranging. From experimental particle physics and computational astrophysics research to aerospace engineering, I've gained proficiencies in Python, MATLAB, R, and Bash, and have significant experience in C++, Mathematica, and Verilog.

Below are a handful of repositories that might provide further insight on what kind of work I have done in these languages.

While coding has come to be one of my great passions, physics still firmly claims that distinction as well. In the years since college, I even started a YouTube channel to go through some physics problems from undergraduate and graduate textbooks. If that interests you, the channel is called [Greg Does Physics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCowsP9riC0Jspn6ndGpfzqA). Check it out if you want!

Added backticks let's us do this: `git push`
Let's try referencing a file from another repository. I made a [file called `index.md`](/../../../communicate-using-markdown/blob/main/index.md/) in another GitHub skills tutorial. :+1:
